# Linking Textile Machine terms via Wikidata


## Short summary
Of particular relevance to Congruence Engine is the fact that museum objects have increasingly been added to Wikidata as items. In the context of cultural heritage, having an openly accessible point of reference for different classes and descriptions of objects is of immense value to curators who are keen to facilitate links across institutions. Several projects have been dedicated to creating new Wikidata items relating to specific areas of knowledge, from famous paintings to Chinese women poets. The Heritage Connector project at the Science Museum used Wikidata extensively as the principal way of linking museum objects across collections, and released a number of tools in order to facilitate this process. In the context of the Congruence Engine project, we were interested in investigating ways of creating new Wikidata items in batches, without the need of more complex programming skills.
